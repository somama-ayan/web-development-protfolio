          In any language there are some fundamentals you need to know before you can write even the most elementary
          programs. Here we introduce three such fundamentals:basic program construction, variables, and input/output
          (I/O). It also touches on a variety of other language features, including comments, arithmetic operators, the
          increment operator and data conversion,

          less forbidding, while other languages begin to seem unnecessarily fancy and verbose.Before you learn what

      <article class="Preprocessor-Directives-article">
        <p>
          The preprocessor directive #include tells the compiler to insert another file into your source
          file. In effect, the #include directive is replaced by the contents of the file indicated. Using an
          #include directive to insert another file into your source file is similar to pasting a block of
          text into a document with your word processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          #include is only one of many preprocessor directives, all of which can be identified by the initial # sign.
          The use of preprocessor directives is not as common in C++ as it is in C, but we’ll
          look at a few additional examples as we go along. The type file usually included by #include
          is called a header file.
        </p>
        <h3>Header Files</h3>
        In the FIRST example, the preprocessor directive #include tells the compiler to add the source
        file IOSTREAM to the FIRST.CPP source file before compiling. Why do this? IOSTREAM is an example of a header
        file (sometimes called an include file). It’s concerned with basic input/output
        operations, and contains declarations that are needed by the cout identifier and the<code><<</code> operator.
        Without these declarations, the compiler won’t recognize cout and will think <code><<</code> is being used
        incorrectly. There are many such include files. The newer Standard C++ header files don’t have
        a file extension, but some older header files, left over from the days of the C language, have
        the extension .H.

          This second character constant, ‘\t’, is an odd one. Like ‘\n’, which we encountered earlier,
it’s an example of an escape sequence. The name reflects the fact that the backslash causes an
“escape” from the normal way characters are interpreted. In this case the t is interpreted not as
the character ‘t’ but as the tab character. A tab causes printing to continue at the next tab stop.
In console-mode programs, tab stops are positioned every eight spaces. Another character constant, 
‘\n’, is sent directly to cout in the last line of the program.

        <p>
          Comments are an important part of any program. They help the person writing a program, and
          anyone else who must read the source file, understand what’s going on. The compiler ignores
          comments, so they do not add to the file size or execution time of the executable program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comments are almost always a good thing. Most programmers don’t use enough of them. If
          you’re tempted to leave out comments, remember that not everyone is as smart as you; they
          may need more explanation than you do about what your program is doing. Also, you may not
          be as smart next month, when you’ve forgotten key details of your program’s operation, as you
          are today.
          Use comments to explain to the person looking at the listing what you’re trying to do. The
          details are in the program statements themselves, so the comments should concentrate on the
          big picture, clarifying your reasons for using a certain statement or group of statements.

        <h1>Integer Variables</h1>
      </header>
      <article class="Integer-Variables-article">
        <p>
          Variables are the most fundamental part of any language. A variable has a symbolic name and
          can be given a variety of values. Variables are located in particular places in the computer’s
          memory. When a variable is given a value, that value is actually placed in the memory space
          assigned to the variable. Most popular languages use the same general variable types, such as
          integers, floating-point numbers, and characters, so you are probably already familiar with the
          ideas behind them.
          Integer variables represent integer numbers like 1, 30,000, and –27. Such numbers are used for
          counting discrete numbers of objects, like 11 pencils or 99 bottles of beer. Unlike floatingpoint numbers,
          integers have no fractional part; you can express the idea of four using integers,
          but not four and one-half.
        </p>
        <h3>Defining Integer Variable</h3>
        <p>Integer variables exist in several sizes, but the most commonly used is type int. The amount of
          memory occupied by the integer types is system dependent. On a 32-bit system such as Windows,
          an int occupies 4 bytes (which is 32 bits) of memory. This allows an int to hold numbers in the
          range from –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Figure 2.3 shows an integer variable in memory.</p>
        <h3>Declarations and Definitions</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s digress for a moment to note a subtle distinction between the terms definition and declaration as
          applied to variables.
          A declaration introduces a variable’s name (such as var1) into a program and specifies its type
          (such as int). However, if a declaration also sets aside memory for the variable, it is also
          called a definition. The statements<br>
          <code>int var1;</code><br>
          <code>int var2;</code><br>
          in the INTVARS program are definitions, as well as declarations, because they set aside memory
          for var1 and var2. We’ll be concerned mostly with declarations that are also definitions, but
          later on we’ll see various kinds of declarations that are not definitions.

        <h1>Floating Point Types</h1>

      <article class="Floating-Point-Types-article">
        <p>
          We’ve talked about type int and type char, both of which represent numbers as integers—that
          is, numbers without a fractional part. Now let’s examine a different way of storing numbers—
          as floating-point variables.
          Floating-point variables represent numbers with a decimal place—like 3.1415927, 0.0000625,
          and –10.2. They have both an integer part, to the left of the decimal point, and a fractional part,
          to the right. Floating-point variables represent what mathematicians call real numbers, which
          are used for measurable quantities such as distance, area, and temperature. They typically have
          a fractional part.
          There are three kinds of floating-point variables in C++: type float, type double, and type
          long double. Let’s start with the smallest of these, type float.

      <article class="Type-double-and-long-double">
        <p>
          The larger floating point types, double and long double, are similar to float except that they
          require more memory space and provide a wider range of values and more precision. Type
          double requires 8 bytes of storage and handles numbers in the range from 1.7x10–308 to
          1.7x10308 with a precision of 15 digits. Type long double is compiler-dependent but is often
          the same as double.
