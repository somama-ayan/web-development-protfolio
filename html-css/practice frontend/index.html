                Kehwa is the local take on herbal teas and green teas, with local varieties including many different
                tastes
                and blends. Pakistani kehwa is brewed strong and consumed religiously in almost every part of the
                country,
                with a side of sweets and other delicacies in line with regional palettes.

                With many more blends presented from every community, it’s clear that the connection people share over a
                simple cup of chai goes a long way. In a country as diverse as Pakistan, with an equally diverse palette
                of
                chais, the culture shared over this drink is essential to the local experience.

                into
                spicy chai. The local blend includes cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, pepper, and a variety of other locally
                sourced spices seasoned according to taste and local preference. Especially during the colder months of
                winter, this cup of tea cannot be missed.
